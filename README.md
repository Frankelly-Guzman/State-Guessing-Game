# U.S. States Guessing Game

The U.S. States Guessing Game is a simple Python program that tests your knowledge of U.S. states and their locations on a map. The game displays a blank map of the United States, and you must guess the names of the states by typing them in.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the game, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python: The game is written in Python. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- pandas: You can install the `pandas` library using pip (Python's package manager):

  ```bash
  pip install pandas
  ```

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/State-Guessing-Game.git
cd State-Guessing-Game
```

2. Run the game script:

```bash
python state_guessing_game.py
```
The game will display a blank map of the United States and prompt you to guess the names of the states.

Type the name of a U.S. state and press Enter to make a guess.

If you want to exit the game, simply type "Exit."

The game keeps track of your progress and displays how many states you've guessed correctly out of 50.

If you exit the game, a list of states you haven't guessed yet will be saved to a file called states_to_learn.csv.

## Customization
You can customize the game by modifying the Python script. For example, you can change the map image, add a timer, or adjust the game logic.

## Data Source
The game uses data from the 50_states.csv file, which contains the names and coordinates of U.S. states.
